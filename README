Anonymous_identity uses socksyipy, a indirect fork of https://code.google.com/p/socksipy-branch/. The script
mainly scrapes the fakenamegenerator.com site to generate identites. It adds proxy (SOCKS5, SOCKS4, HTTP) 
support sucht that I am able to programmatically generate identies in a anonymous way.
